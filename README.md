# Libft Project

## Chapter I: Introduction

C programming can sometimes be tedious, especially when you donâ€™t have access to standard library functions. The **Libft project** is designed to help you understand how these essential functions work by **implementing them yourself**.  

By creating your own library, you will not only deepen your understanding of C, but also have a **reusable set of functions** for your future assignments and projects in C programming.  

---

## Purpose

- Learn how standard C functions work under the hood.  
- Build a personal library of reusable C functions (`libft`).  
- Gain experience working with pointers, memory management, and string manipulation.  
- Develop good coding habits by following project guidelines strictly.  

---

## Guidelines

- You are encouraged to **expand your libft** throughout the year as you learn more functions.  
- For every new project, **ensure that the functions used in your library comply with the project requirements**.  
- Always write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
